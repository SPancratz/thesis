* Define Omega in the chapter on preliminaries, and possibly 
  also the recurring basis of monomials, then refer to this 
  definition in suitable places

* Definite monomial notation in a suitable place

* Need a result that r(0) is non-zero, poles and apparent poles(?)

* Improve qadic_teichmuller, removing unnecessary reductions, 
  hopefully this will make it beat Magma throughout

* Improve square root
